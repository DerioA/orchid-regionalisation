Five years monitoring of the Lake Muir-Unicup wetland system, south western Australia. Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia 87, pp. 29-33 (Creative Commons Attribution (International) (CC-BY 4.0 (Int)) Conditions of Access All users need to acknowledge and agree to the following conditions before using NatureMap content: Data within NatureMap is provided with the participation and good will of data custodians and I will endeavour, where possible, to seek a collaborative approach with custodians in any research or papers published using NatureMap data. Re-sale of raw data or the commercial use of images or descriptive text (other than generated maps, species lists and reports) on this site is unauthorised unless written permission is obtained from the Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC). Appropriate and full acknowledgement of DEC and species data custodians (see Data Directory) must always be given in any publication that includes data sourced here. Data provided through NatureMap represents positive records of flora and fauna occurrence. The absence of a record should not be taken to mean flora or fauna is necessarily absent from an area. (To minimise the effect of data gaps, a buffer area should be applied that is reflective of the likelihood of surveys or collections having been undertaken in the target area.) My username and password will not be passed on to any other person or organisation. DEC and data custodians reserve the right to revoke registration if the above conditions of access are not complied with. I will notify DEC if any relevant conditions change that might affect my NatureMap authorisation level. Also note: Custodians have kindly granted permission to allow relatively large subsets of data to be downloaded for a wide range of uses, including within a commercial context. Note, however, it is not NatureMap policy to allow the downloading of entire datasets It is current custodian policy to only grant Advanced Access (see the Registration page) for bona fide research or conservation planning purposes. This does not extend to use within a commercial context. While this may appear restrictive, in fact basic registration provides a great deal of information on both conservation and non-conservation taxa, and all users are encouraged to explore NatureMap's sophisticated querying and mapping capabilities. DEC's Species and Communities Branch continues to provide information on detailed localities of conservation taxa to consultants and other commercial users on a fee-for-service basis. Fair Use Guidlines As stated above, we want as many people as possible to make use of the data available within NatureMap, so long as that use is "fair". It is considered fair for anyone to use information from NatureMap for conservation or planning purposes, including incorporating that information into reports or papers, or summarising and value-adding to data. It is not considered fair use to download raw data and on-sell it. That would contravene copyright. It is also bad business, because anyone could obtain the same data directly from NatureMap. Of particular note: Maps, species lists, reports and raw data may be freely used by anyone, including commercial consultants, for research, planning, generating reports and compilations, or for personal use, so long as the above conditions of access are complied with. Raw data, i.e. bulk detail records of individual locations that have been downloaded from NatureMap and not summarised, compiled or modified in any substantial way, may not be on-sold or rebadged without written permission from the Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC). This is consistent with Australian Copyright law. Other descriptive text and images, such as Thematic content on wetlands or ecological attributes, remain the property of NatureMap and copyright holders and may not be used without written permission from DEC.

All users need to acknowledge and agree to the following conditions before using NatureMap content:

Data within NatureMap is provided with the participation and good will of data custodians and I will endeavour, where possible, to seek a collaborative approach with custodians in any research or papers published using NatureMap data.

Re-sale of raw data or the commercial use of images or descriptive text (other than generated maps, species lists and reports) on this site is unauthorised unless written permission is obtained from the Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC).

Appropriate and full acknowledgement of DEC and species data custodians (see Data Directory) must always be given in any publication that includes data sourced here.

Data provided through NatureMap represents positive records of flora and fauna occurrence. The absence of a record should not be taken to mean flora or fauna is necessarily absent from an area. (To minimise the effect of data gaps, a buffer area should be applied that is reflective of the likelihood of surveys or collections having been undertaken in the target area.)

My username and password will not be passed on to any other person or organisation.

DEC and data custodians reserve the right to revoke registration if the above conditions of access are not complied with.

I will notify DEC if any relevant conditions change that might affect my NatureMap authorisation level.

Also note:

Custodians have kindly granted permission to allow relatively large subsets of data to be downloaded for a wide range of uses, including within a commercial context. Note, however, it is not NatureMap policy to allow the downloading of entire datasets

It is current custodian policy to only grant Advanced Access (see the Registration page) for bona fide research or conservation planning purposes. This does not extend to use within a commercial context. While this may appear restrictive, in fact basic registration provides a great deal of information on both conservation and non-conservation taxa, and all users are encouraged to explore NatureMap's sophisticated querying and mapping capabilities. DEC's Species and Communities Branch continues to provide information on detailed localities of conservation taxa to consultants and other commercial users on a fee-for-service basis.

Fair Use Guidlines

As stated above, we want as many people as possible to make use of the data available within NatureMap, so long as that use is "fair". It is considered fair for anyone to use information from NatureMap for conservation or planning purposes, including incorporating that information into reports or papers, or summarising and value-adding to data.

It is not considered fair use to download raw data and on-sell it. That would contravene copyright. It is also bad business, because anyone could obtain the same data directly from NatureMap.

Of particular note:

Maps, species lists, reports and raw data may be freely used by anyone, including commercial consultants, for research, planning, generating reports and compilations, or for personal use, so long as the above conditions of access are complied with.

Raw data, i.e. bulk detail records of individual locations that have been downloaded from NatureMap and not summarised, compiled or modified in any substantial way, may not be on-sold or rebadged without written permission from the Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC). This is consistent with Australian Copyright law.

Other descriptive text and images, such as Thematic content on wetlands or ecological attributes, remain the property of NatureMap and copyright holders and may not be used without written permission from DEC.

All users need to acknowledge and agree to the following conditions before using NatureMap content:

Data within NatureMap is provided with the participation and good will of data custodians and I will endeavour, where possible, to seek a collaborative approach with custodians in any research or papers published using NatureMap data.

Re-sale of raw data or the commercial use of images or descriptive text (other than generated maps, species lists and reports) on this site is unauthorised unless written permission is obtained from the Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC).

Appropriate and full acknowledgement of DEC and species data custodians (see Data Directory) must always be given in any publication that includes data sourced here.

Data provided through NatureMap represents positive records of flora and fauna occurrence. The absence of a record should not be taken to mean flora or fauna is necessarily absent from an area. (To minimise the effect of data gaps, a buffer area should be applied that is reflective of the likelihood of surveys or collections having been undertaken in the target area.)

My username and password will not be passed on to any other person or organisation.

DEC and data custodians reserve the right to revoke registration if the above conditions of access are not complied with.

I will notify DEC if any relevant conditions change that might affect my NatureMap authorisation level.

Also note:

Custodians have kindly granted permission to allow relatively large subsets of data to be downloaded for a wide range of uses, including within a commercial context. Note, however, it is not NatureMap policy to allow the downloading of entire datasets

It is current custodian policy to only grant Advanced Access (see the Registration page) for bona fide research or conservation planning purposes. This does not extend to use within a commercial context. While this may appear restrictive, in fact basic registration provides a great deal of information on both conservation and non-conservation taxa, and all users are encouraged to explore NatureMap's sophisticated querying and mapping capabilities. DEC's Species and Communities Branch continues to provide information on detailed localities of conservation taxa to consultants and other commercial users on a fee-for-service basis.

Fair Use Guidlines

As stated above, we want as many people as possible to make use of the data available within NatureMap, so long as that use is "fair". It is considered fair for anyone to use information from NatureMap for conservation or planning purposes, including incorporating that information into reports or papers, or summarising and value-adding to data.

It is not considered fair use to download raw data and on-sell it. That would contravene copyright. It is also bad business, because anyone could obtain the same data directly from NatureMap.

Of particular note:

Maps, species lists, reports and raw data may be freely used by anyone, including commercial consultants, for research, planning, generating reports and compilations, or for personal use, so long as the above conditions of access are complied with.

Raw data, i.e. bulk detail records of individual locations that have been downloaded from NatureMap and not summarised, compiled or modified in any substantial way, may not be on-sold or rebadged without written permission from the Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC). This is consistent with Australian Copyright law.

Other descriptive text and images, such as Thematic content on wetlands or ecological attributes, remain the property of NatureMap and copyright holders and may not be used without written permission from DEC.
